## Razorpay Clone

I created a clone of Razorpay, a popular payment gateway platform, using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS. With HTML, I structured the content of the website and used CSS to define the layout and styling of the page elements. I used Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, to speed up the development process and create a responsive design that works seamlessly across different devices. The clone website features a clean and modern design that closely resembles the original Razorpay platform. I made sure to use similar color schemes, typography, and icons to maintain consistency with the brand.
